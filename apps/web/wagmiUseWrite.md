useWriteContract

Copy page


Action for executing a write function on a contract.

A "write" function on a Solidity contract modifies the state of the blockchain. These types of functions require gas to be executed, hence a transaction is broadcasted in order to change the state.

Import

import { useWriteContract } from 'wagmi'
Usage

index.tsx

abi.ts

config.ts

import { useWriteContract } from 'wagmi'
import { abi } from './abi'

function App() {
  const writeContract = useWriteContract()
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={() => 
        writeContract.mutate({ 
          abi,
          address: '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f',
          functionName: 'transferFrom',
          args: [
            '0xd2135CfB216b74109775236E36d4b433F1DF507B',
            '0xA0Cf798816D4b9b9866b5330EEa46a18382f251e',
            123n,
          ],
       })
      }
    >
      Transfer
    </button>
  )
}
Synchronous Usage
If you want to wait for the transaction to be included in a block, you can use useWriteContractSync:


index.tsx

abi.ts

config.ts

import { useWriteContractSync } from 'wagmi'
import { abi } from './abi'

function App() {
  const writeContractSync = useWriteContractSync()
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={() => 
        writeContractSync.mutate({ 
          abi,
          address: '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f',
          functionName: 'transferFrom',
          args: [
            '0xd2135CfB216b74109775236E36d4b433F1DF507B',
            '0xA0Cf798816D4b9b9866b5330EEa46a18382f251e',
            123n,
          ],
       })
      }
    >
      Transfer
    </button>
  )
}
Parameters

import { type UseWriteContractParameters } from 'wagmi'
config
Config | undefined

Config to use instead of retrieving from the nearest WagmiProvider.


index.tsx

config.ts

import { useWriteContract } from 'wagmi'
import { config } from './config'

function App() {
  const writeContract = useWriteContract({
    config,
  })
}

mutation
TanStack Query parameters. See the TanStack Query mutation docs for more info.

Wagmi does not support passing all TanStack Query parameters

TanStack Query parameters, like mutationFn and mutationKey, are used internally to make Wagmi work and you cannot override them. Check out the source to see what parameters are not supported. All parameters listed below are supported.

gcTime
number | Infinity | undefined

The time in milliseconds that unused/inactive cache data remains in memory. When a mutation's cache becomes unused or inactive, that cache data will be garbage collected after this duration. When different cache times are specified, the longest one will be used.
If set to Infinity, will disable garbage collection
meta
Record<string, unknown> | undefined

If set, stores additional information on the mutation cache entry that can be used as needed. It will be accessible wherever writeContract is available (e.g. onError, onSuccess functions).

networkMode
'online' | 'always' | 'offlineFirst' | undefined

defaults to 'online'
see Network Mode for more information.
onError
((error: WriteContractErrorType, variables: WriteContractVariables, context?: context | undefined) => Promise<unknown> | unknown) | undefined

This function will fire if the mutation encounters an error and will be passed the error.

onMutate
((variables: WriteContractVariables) => Promise<context | void> | context | void) | undefined

This function will fire before the mutation function is fired and is passed the same variables the mutation function would receive
Useful to perform optimistic updates to a resource in hopes that the mutation succeeds
The value returned from this function will be passed to both the onError and onSettled functions in the event of a mutation failure and can be useful for rolling back optimistic updates.
onSuccess
((data: WriteContractReturnType, variables: WriteContractVariables, context?: context | undefined) => Promise<unknown> | unknown) | undefined

This function will fire when the mutation is successful and will be passed the mutation's result.

onSettled
((data: WriteContractReturnType, error: WriteContractErrorType, variables: WriteContractVariables, context?: context | undefined) => Promise<unknown> | unknown) | undefined

This function will fire when the mutation is either successfully fetched or encounters an error and be passed either the data or error

queryClient
QueryClient

Use this to use a custom QueryClient. Otherwise, the one from the nearest context will be used.

retry
boolean | number | ((failureCount: number, error: WriteContractErrorType) => boolean) | undefined

Defaults to 0.
If false, failed mutations will not retry.
If true, failed mutations will retry infinitely.
If set to an number, e.g. 3, failed mutations will retry until the failed mutations count meets that number.
retryDelay
number | ((retryAttempt: number, error: WriteContractErrorType) => number) | undefined

This function receives a retryAttempt integer and the actual Error and returns the delay to apply before the next attempt in milliseconds.
A function like attempt => Math.min(attempt > 1 ? 2 ** attempt * 1000 : 1000, 30 * 1000) applies exponential backoff.
A function like attempt => attempt * 1000 applies linear backoff.
Return Type

import { type UseWriteContractReturnType } from 'wagmi'
The return type's data property is inferrable via the combination of abi, functionName, and args. Check out the TypeScript docs for more info.


TanStack Query mutation docs

mutate
(variables: WriteContractVariables, { onSuccess, onSettled, onError }) => void

The mutation function you can call with variables to trigger the mutation and optionally hooks on additional callback options.

variables
WriteContractVariables

The variables object to pass to the writeContract action.

onSuccess
(data: WriteContractReturnType, variables: WriteContractVariables, context: TContext) => void

This function will fire when the mutation is successful and will be passed the mutation's result.

onError
(error: WriteContractErrorType, variables: WriteContractVariables, context: TContext | undefined) => void

This function will fire if the mutation encounters an error and will be passed the error.

onSettled
(data: WriteContractReturnType | undefined, error: WriteContractErrorType | null, variables: WriteContractVariables, context: TContext | undefined) => void

This function will fire when the mutation is either successfully fetched or encounters an error and be passed either the data or error
If you make multiple requests, onSuccess will fire only after the latest call you've made.
mutateAsync
(variables: WriteContractVariables, { onSuccess, onSettled, onError }) => Promise<WriteContractReturnType>

Similar to mutate but returns a promise which can be awaited.

data
WriteContractReturnType | undefined

writeContract return type
Defaults to undefined
The last successfully resolved data for the mutation.
error
WriteContractErrorType | null

The error object for the mutation, if an error was encountered.

failureCount
number

The failure count for the mutation.
Incremented every time the mutation fails.
Reset to 0 when the mutation succeeds.
failureReason
WriteContractErrorType | null

The failure reason for the mutation retry.
Reset to null when the mutation succeeds.
isError / isIdle / isPending / isSuccess
boolean

Boolean variables derived from status.

isPaused
boolean

will be true if the mutation has been paused.
see Network Mode for more information.
reset
() => void

A function to clean the mutation internal state (e.g. it resets the mutation to its initial state).

status
'idle' | 'pending' | 'error' | 'success'

'idle' initial status prior to the mutation function executing.
'pending' if the mutation is currently executing.
'error' if the last mutation attempt resulted in an error.
'success' if the last mutation attempt was successful.
submittedAt
number

The timestamp for when the mutation was submitted.
Defaults to 0.
variables
WriteContractVariables | undefined

The variables object passed to mutate.
Defaults to undefined.
Type Inference
With abi setup correctly, TypeScript will infer the correct types for functionName, args, and the value. See the Wagmi TypeScript docs for more information.
