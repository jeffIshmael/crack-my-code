useReadContract

Copy page


Hook for calling a read-only function on a contract, and returning the response.

A read-only function (constant function) on a Solidity contract is denoted by a pure or view keyword. They can only read the state of the contract, and cannot make any changes to it. Since read-only methods do not change the state of the contract, they do not require any gas to be executed, and can be called by any user without the need to pay for gas.

query
TanStack Query parameters. See the TanStack Query query docs for more info.

Wagmi does not support passing all TanStack Query parameters

TanStack Query parameters, like queryFn and queryKey, are used internally to make Wagmi work and you cannot override them. Check out the source to see what parameters are not supported. All parameters listed below are supported.

enabled
boolean | undefined

Set this to false to disable this query from automatically running.
Can be used for Dependent Queries.
gcTime
number | Infinity | undefined

Defaults to 5 * 60 * 1000 (5 minutes) or Infinity during SSR
The time in milliseconds that unused/inactive cache data remains in memory. When a query's cache becomes unused or inactive, that cache data will be garbage collected after this duration. When different garbage collection times are specified, the longest one will be used.
If set to Infinity, will disable garbage collection
initialData
ReadContractReturnType | (() => ReadContractReturnType) | undefined

If set, this value will be used as the initial data for the query cache (as long as the query hasn't been created or cached yet)
If set to a function, the function will be called once during the shared/root query initialization, and be expected to synchronously return the initialData
Initial data is considered stale by default unless a staleTime has been set.
initialData is persisted to the cache
initialDataUpdatedAt
number | ((() => number | undefined)) | undefined

If set, this value will be used as the time (in milliseconds) of when the initialData itself was last updated.

meta
Record<string, unknown> | undefined

If set, stores additional information on the query cache entry that can be used as needed. It will be accessible wherever the query is available, and is also part of the QueryFunctionContext provided to the queryFn.

networkMode
online' | 'always' | 'offlineFirst' | undefined

Defaults to 'online'
see Network Mode for more information.
notifyOnChangeProps
string[] | 'all' | (() => string[] | 'all') | undefined

If set, the component will only re-render if any of the listed properties change.
If set to ['data', 'error'] for example, the component will only re-render when the data or error properties change.
If set to 'all', the component will opt-out of smart tracking and re-render whenever a query is updated.
If set to a function, the function will be executed to compute the list of properties.
By default, access to properties will be tracked, and the component will only re-render when one of the tracked properties change.
placeholderData
ReadContractReturnType | ((previousValue: ReadContractReturnType | undefined; previousQuery: Query | undefined) => ReadContractReturnType) | undefined

If set, this value will be used as the placeholder data for this particular query observer while the query is still in the pending state.
placeholderData is not persisted to the cache
If you provide a function for placeholderData, as a first argument you will receive previously watched query data if available, and the second argument will be the complete previousQuery instance.
queryClient
QueryClient | undefined

Use this to use a custom QueryClient. Otherwise, the one from the nearest context will be used.

refetchInterval
number | false | ((data: ReadContractReturnType | undefined, query: Query) => number | false | undefined) | undefined

If set to a number, all queries will continuously refetch at this frequency in milliseconds
If set to a function, the function will be executed with the latest data and query to compute a frequency
refetchIntervalInBackground
boolean | undefined

If set to true, queries that are set to continuously refetch with a refetchInterval will continue to refetch while their tab/window is in the background

refetchOnMount
boolean | 'always' | ((query: Query) => boolean | 'always') | undefined

Defaults to true
If set to true, the query will refetch on mount if the data is stale.
If set to false, the query will not refetch on mount.
If set to 'always', the query will always refetch on mount.
If set to a function, the function will be executed with the query to compute the value
refetchOnReconnect
boolean | 'always' | ((query: Query) => boolean | 'always') | undefined

Defaults to true
If set to true, the query will refetch on reconnect if the data is stale.
If set to false, the query will not refetch on reconnect.
If set to 'always', the query will always refetch on reconnect.
If set to a function, the function will be executed with the query to compute the value
refetchOnWindowFocus
boolean | 'always' | ((query: Query) => boolean | 'always') | undefined

Defaults to true
If set to true, the query will refetch on window focus if the data is stale.
If set to false, the query will not refetch on window focus.
If set to 'always', the query will always refetch on window focus.
If set to a function, the function will be executed with the query to compute the value
retry
boolean | number | ((failureCount: number, error: ReadContractErrorType) => boolean) | undefined

If false, failed queries will not retry by default.
If true, failed queries will retry infinitely.
If set to a number, e.g. 3, failed queries will retry until the failed query count meets that number.
Defaults to 3 on the client and 0 on the server
retryDelay
number | ((retryAttempt: number, error: ReadContractErrorType) => number) | undefined

This function receives a retryAttempt integer and the actual Error and returns the delay to apply before the next attempt in milliseconds.
A function like attempt => Math.min(attempt > 1 ? 2 ** attempt * 1000 : 1000, 30 * 1000) applies exponential backoff.
A function like attempt => attempt * 1000 applies linear backoff.
retryOnMount
boolean | undefined

If set to false, the query will not be retried on mount if it contains an error. Defaults to true.

select
((data: ReadContractReturnType) => unknown) | undefined

This option can be used to transform or select a part of the data returned by the query function. It affects the returned data value, but does not affect what gets stored in the query cache.

staleTime
number | Infinity | undefined

Defaults to 0
The time in milliseconds after data is considered stale. This value only applies to the hook it is defined on.
If set to Infinity, the data will never be considered stale
structuralSharing
boolean | (((oldData: ReadContractReturnType | undefined, newData: ReadContractReturnType) => ReadContractReturnType)) | undefined

Defaults to true
If set to false, structural sharing between query results will be disabled.
If set to a function, the old and new data values will be passed through this function, which should combine them into resolved data for the query. This way, you can retain references from the old data to improve performance even when that data contains non-serializable values.
Return Type

import { type UseReadContractReturnType } from 'wagmi'
The return type's data property is inferrable via the combination of abi, functionName, and args. Check out the TypeScript docs for more info.


TanStack Query query docs

data
ReadContractReturnType

The last successfully resolved data for the query.
Defaults to undefined.
dataUpdatedAt
number

The timestamp for when the query most recently returned the status as 'success'.

error
null | ReadContractErrorType

The error object for the query, if an error was thrown.
Defaults to null
errorUpdatedAt
number

The timestamp for when the query most recently returned the status as 'error'.

errorUpdateCount
number

The sum of all errors.

failureCount
number

The failure count for the query.
Incremented every time the query fails.
Reset to 0 when the query succeeds.
failureReason
null | ReadContractErrorType

The failure reason for the query retry.
Reset to null when the query succeeds.
fetchStatus
'fetching' | 'idle' | 'paused'

fetching Is true whenever the queryFn is executing, which includes initial pending as well as background refetches.
paused The query wanted to fetch, but has been paused.
idle The query is not fetching.
See Network Mode for more information.
isError / isPending / isSuccess
boolean

Boolean variables derived from status.

isFetched
boolean

Will be true if the query has been fetched.

isFetchedAfterMount
boolean

Will be true if the query has been fetched after the component mounted.
This property can be used to not show any previously cached data.
isFetching / isPaused
boolean

Boolean variables derived from fetchStatus.

isLoading
boolean

Is true whenever the first fetch for a query is in-flight
Is the same as isFetching && isPending
isLoadingError
boolean

Will be true if the query failed while fetching for the first time.

isPlaceholderData
boolean

Will be true if the data shown is the placeholder data.

isRefetchError
boolean

Will be true if the query failed while refetching.

isRefetching
boolean

Is true whenever a background refetch is in-flight, which does not include initial 'pending'.
Is the same as isFetching && !isPending
isStale
boolean

Will be true if the data in the cache is invalidated or if the data is older than the given staleTime.

refetch
(options: { cancelRefetch?: boolean | undefined; throwOnError?: boolean | undefined }) => Promise<UseQueryResult<ReadContractReturnType, ReadContractErrorType>>

A function to manually refetch the query.
throwOnError
When set to true, an error will be thrown if the query fails.
When set to false, an error will be logged if the query fails.
cancelRefetch
When set to true, a currently running request will be cancelled before a new request is made.
When set to false, no refetch will be made if there is already a request running.
Defaults to true
status
'error' | 'pending' | 'success'

pending if there's no cached data and no query attempt was finished yet.
error if the query attempt resulted in an error. The corresponding error property has the error received from the attempted fetch
success if the query has received a response with no errors and is ready to display its data. The corresponding data property on the query is the data received from the successful fetch or if the query's enabled property is set to false and has not been fetched yet data is the first initialData supplied to the query on initialization.
Type Inference
With abi setup correctly, TypeScript will infer the correct types for functionName, args, and the return type. See the Wagmi TypeScript docs for more information.
